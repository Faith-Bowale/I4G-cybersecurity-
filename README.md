## Objectives
Use a hashing program to verify the integrity of data.
## Background / Scenario
It is important to understand when data has been corrupted or it has been tampered with. A hashing program
can be used to verify if data has changed, or if it has remained the same. A hashing program performs a hash
function on data or a file, which returns a (usually much shorter) value. There are many different hash
functions, some very simple and some very complex. When the same hash is performed on the same data,
the value that is returned is always the same. If any change is performed on the data, the hash value returned
will be different.
